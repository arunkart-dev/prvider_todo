✅ Just copy this into your `README.md` file.  
It already includes **features, structure, install steps, screenshots, license, and .gitignore** → everything in one place.  

👉 Do you also want me to create a **badges section** (like build passing, Flutter version, stars) at the top to make it look even more like a professional open-source project?
